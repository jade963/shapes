					<h1>Brief</h1>
				<p>This project aims to create a basic drawing program after the fashion of Google Draw, for the use of
					 students in schools. The program should allow students to draw customisable shapes and lines. It
					needs to be based in a canvas environment.

				<h3>Initial test</h3>

					<source src="assets/video/sprint_one_test.mov" type="video/mp4">

				</video>
				<p>This video shows a test of the Sprint One code.<br><br>
					As can be seen, the sprint’s main goal of allowing the user to draw a permanent rectangle on the
					canvas has been achieved. However, there are a few bugs.
					<ol>
				<li>
					The program does not record when the mouse has left the canvas. As a result, if the mouse leaves
					the canvas while dragging a rectangle, the rectangle disappears. This is confusing and irritating
					for the user. It seems that it can only be fixed by the addition of strict limits around the
					drawing area - this is something that will take some consideration and is already planned for a
					later sprint, so I will leave this bug for now in the interest of prioritising.
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					The “guide” circle in the centre of the temporary rectangle that is shown while the user is
					dragging does not resize with the square. While this has no impact on the program’s functionality,
					it looks awkward and means that the user is not actually assisted by its presence as intended. I
					believe it could be fixed by making the radius responsive to the dimensions of
					the rectangle it is contained in, e.g.:
					<pre style="font-size: 1em">
					<code class="javascript">
						if(this.h < this.w){
								this.r = Math.abs(this.h/10)
							}
							else if(this.h > this.w){
								this.r = Math.abs(this.w/10)
							}</code>
					</pre>
					Here, the drawStrokeCircle function (the function for the guide circle) is able to recognise whether
					the width is less than the height or vice versa, and then make sure its radius stays
					smaller than it.
				</li>
			</ol>

 	<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>As shown in the test above, the fixes applied to bug #2 found in the initial program test have been
				successful. Bug #1 has been added to the project backlog to be fixed in a later sprint.<br><br> On the
					whole
				this could be considered a successful sprint. Although the program is still extremely basic, I have a
				working canvas and an interactive platform, important fundamentals that will allow me to work on adding
				to the program in an efficient way. I have also been able to identify two bugs and fix one of them.
					<br><br> I think the next sprint should give the user more choice
				over how they use the program - in its current state, it's pretty boring. To allow the user to choose,
				I will have to code buttons and add some very basic shapes to the program's repertoire (e.g. a circle,
				line, and ellipse. I already have the code for these as they make up the "guide" shapes, making these
					additions quick and easy, allowing me to focus on the more complex code for buttons.)
					The buttons are another important fundamental that must work before I can
					add any more complicated functions, as this program is intended to be user-oriented and most of the
					planned features will simply be providing the user with new options. </p>

				<h2>Testing</h2>
				<h3>Component test #1 - new shapes</h3>
				<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/sprint_two_comptest_one.png" alt="">
				<p>This screenshot shows the successful implementation of part one of this sprint - the new shapes,
				drawn using their "basic" functions.</p>
				<h3>Component test #2 - drawing new shapes</h3>
				<video class="center" controls>
					<source src="assets/video/sprint_two_comptest_two.mov" type="video/mp4">
					Your browser does not support the video tag.
				</video>
				<p>This video shows an early test of the new shapes added to the program - the ellipse, circle, and
					line. Although the code is functional, some problems are revealed that interfere with the program's
					usability.<ol>
				<li>Placeholder code has been used at this stage, with the variable "this.choice" deciding
					which shape is to be drawn. This will be changed at the next step of this sprint when buttons are
					added - since the goal is for the user to be able to make changes without having to change the base
					code. because buttons have not yet been added. However, at this stage it is impossible for multiple
					shapes to be drawn on the canvas at once, because the page needs to be refreshed each time the
					drawing shape is changed. <br><br></li>
				<li>It appears that the bug found and fixed in Sprint One, where the guide circle inside the rectangle
				did not resize appropriately, was not fixed after all. This is because the code the guide circle uses
				to determine whether it should be sized according to the width or the height relied on an equation that
				calculated the width/height by subtracting the xMouse or yMouse value from the xStart or yStart
					value, then. However, this doesn't work because the user is able to make the width or height
					negative by simply dragging the mouse left or up from the Start point. Therefore, if the width is
				calculated to be -300, and the height is 30, the computer sees the width as smaller and therefore the
				radius resizes to be 1/10 of 300 (30) instead of 1/10 of 30 (3). This problem will require some
				consideration and different approaches and there is still a significant amount of work required for this
					sprint, so fixing it will be added to the agenda for Sprint Three.<br><br></li>
				<li>The final problem is with the guide shapes for the circle. The circle was added so the user had an
				option of creating the "perfect" shape, as an alternative to the ellipse. However, there is no
				equivalent "perfect" guide shape (which would be a square) to match it. The rectangle as its guide shape
				does not resize appropriately to the circle, because the width and the height are different. </li>

						<h3>Circle - error correction</h3>
						<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/sprint_two_error_one.jpg"></div>
					<div class="col">
						<h3>Final verdict</h3>
						<p>After solutions 1 and 2 proved unsuccessful, I began planning for solution
					#3, or the square function. However, during this time I realised that even a successful square or
					circle would be very restrictive to the user's freedom of movement, because it can only be expanded
					or contracted along a diagonal centre-line. This is true of squares even in programs such as Google
					Draw; by nature, the "perfect" shape is restrictive. I have decided, therefore, to scrap both the
					square and the circle functions. I believe the purpose of these functions can be much more
						efficiently served by the user simply choosing the rectangle or ellipse option, and if necessary
						use the grid as a guide to attain their desired proportions. Meanwhile, the user will not have
						to deal with the irritation of strict limits being placed on their range of movement - something
						that is rather the antithesis of the theoretical freedom a drawing program should allow. </p></div>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>As shown in the test above, the goals of this sprint have been met - the program now has a working
				button class as well as ellipse and line functions, although the intended circle class was scrapped.
				<br><br> To be fixed in the next sprint is the problem with the guide circle found when a rectangle is
				being drawn. The cause has been identified, and the fix will be part of the planning for sprint three.
				<br><br> In terms of general extension of the program, the next steps for this program are to allow the
					user the option
				not just to choose their shapes, but to choose the characteristics of those shapes - in sprint three,
				they should be able to toggle stroke & fill and have some influence over stroke and fill styles.
				<br><br>
					While reviewing the test, a few possible improvements have occurred to me. <br><br>
					First, there should be
					more differentiation between
					the "guide shapes" that the user sees while drawing a shape and the temporary outline of the actual
					shape - perhaps this could be differentiated by having the guide shapes as dotted lines, and the
					temporary version of the final shape as a solid one.<br><br>
					Second, there is currently no stroked edge around a button, and a selected button is indicated by a
					transparent fill shade. However, the plan for this sprint is to offer the user with a colour palette
					that allows them to choose the colour they want. If the appearance of a selected button is indicated
					by changing the colour of the button, this may cause confusion. Therefore, I would like to alter
					this functionality in the next sprint by adding a stroke around the buttons whenever the button is
					 selected, instead - this will align nicely with the main goal of the sprint.

<h1>Sprint Three</h1>
				<h2>Aim</h2>
				<p>By the end of this sprint, the user should be able to toggle stroke & fill for their shapes, &
				dictate their colour. I also aim to solve a couple of minor glitches held over from the previous sprint.
